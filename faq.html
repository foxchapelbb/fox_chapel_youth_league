				<p><u>Do you have to be a Fox Chapel Area School District resident to play Winter League?</u></p>
                <p>No, anyone can play.</p>
                
                <p><u>How long are the practices, and how often do they practice?</u> </p>
                <p>Adult leagues do not   practice. Youth teams     normally practice for (1 hour for 1st &amp;   2nd grades), and up to   (older teams 1.5 hours), once a week, on a   weeknight.  Boys and girls   grades 9th to 12th hold an open gym    scrimmage/ practice with an adult   gym monitor usually weekly.</p>
               
                <p><u>Where do teams practice?</u></p>
                <p>At   either an   elementary, middle school, or High School  gym in the   district. We use   every single gym, every single night, of the entire season in the   district   and even rent additional space to make this work.</p>
                
                <p><u>What time are the practices?</u></p>
                <p>Younger   teams (1st to   4th) normally from 6:00-7:00 or 7:30, and older teams   (5th to 8th)   practice from 7:30-9:00.  High school teams can practice as   late as   10:00pm during the week.  </p>
                
                <p>Travel practices are handled by the travel commissioner and occur on Sunday's during the season.</p>
                
                
                <p><u>When are the games?</u><u> </u></p>
                <p>Adult League's play   during the week ONLY. Each youth team plays a game on Saturday's between   8am and 8pm at gyms in the   district.   </p>
               
                <p><u>How many players are on a team?</u></p>
                <p>Teams     usually   consist of 7 or maximum 8 players divided by grades and   separated by     gender. 1st &amp; 2nd grade will roster 6 players for 3 on 3. 3rd &amp;     4th girls will roster 6-7 for 4v4.  This is all based on numbers of     coaches, available gym   space, and playing format.  We try to keep it   smaller to allow more   playing time.</p>
                
                <p><u>H</u><u>ow are the age groups divided up?</u></p>
                <p>Generally,   we group   grades in pairs, 3rd-4th, 5th-6th etc.  We may split them into   single   ages, if numbers are high enough to have at least 6 teams at   each   level. <em>Movement in age groups may occur if numbers are low, we apologize for this in advance.</em></p>
               
                <p><u>CURRENT GROUPINGS</u></p>
                <p><u>Girls</u> 1st-2nd, 3rd-4th, 5th-6th, 7th-8th, and 9th-12th.  </p>
                <p><u>Boys</u> 1st-2nd, 3rd-4th,  5th-6th, 7th-8th, 9th-10th,11th-12th</p>
                <p><u>Men's league</u> - Out of High School (OHS), 40 and over (40OV) Must be 40 by the Final Date of March Madness.<br>
                </p>
                <p><u>Women's league - Out of High Schoo (OHS) (May Supplement with High School players as needed)</u></p>
                
                <p><u>Do you lower the hoops for the younger grades, like 1st-2nd?</u></p>
                <p>Yes,   we lower the   hoops to 8' approximately and they play side to   side at O'Hara.    3rd-4th graders move to 10' hoops and play full court,   due to space,   and hoop lowering limitations at our gyms.  See rules   section for more   on our league playing time rules, etc.</p>
                
                <p><u>PLAYING UP</u></p>
                <p>This is a parents decision and they play at their own risk.<br>
                </p>
              
                <p><u>My child is playing travel.  Can they also play Winter League / rec?   Do the games conflict?</u></p>
                <p>Many   travel players   play both travel and Winter League.  Most travel games   are during the   week which may conflict with some practices, but not   games.  There a   potential conflict playing in both as they may miss   games.</p>
                
                <p><u>How are teams made up?</u></p>
                <p>Twins, Triplets etc.   are always automatically put onto the same team, unless otherwise   directed by the parent.  All   teams are decided by draft, with the   exception of 1st-2nd grade.  This decision was made to keep coaches     from stacking their teams.</p>
                
                <p><u>How does the draft work?</u></p>
                <p>All     players are   rated during their 1st season of play.  After the 1st year,   a players   rating stays with them hidden in our system from public   viewing.   Coaches receive rating information prior to the   draft and this   information is held in the strictest confidence.   As   players improve,     commissioners and coaches dialogue to update those ratings each year.      Each round of the draft,   the coaches select available players in   reverse order of strength.  In   other words, the weaker team drafts   1st, each round and the stronger   teams last each and every round of   the draft.</p>
                
                <p><u>What is the rating scale for players?</u></p>
                <p>We   rate players 0-5, 0   being the best and 5 the weakest.   We do use 1/2   points as well.    The rating system, while not perfect is a sincere   attempt to balance   teams and is the best system currently out there   without an onsite   player evaluation.<br>
                </p>
                
                <p><u>What do the ratings numbers mean?</u></p>
                <p>0- Rare player can score at will and does so virtually every game</p>
                
                <p>1- Very good scorer scores high point almost weekly</p>
                <p>2- Very good defender but doesn't score a whole lot.  Does a lot well.<br>
                </p>
                <p>3   - Avg. Winter   League player.  Scores low points per game. Generally   understands the   plays, etc and is a good part of the team. Knows their   role!!<br>
                </p>
                <p>4 - Below avg.  May think their role is different than it really is.<br>
                </p>
                <p>5 - ..............fill in the blank.</p>
                
                <p><u>How do you rate a 1st year player?</u></p>
                <p>This   is our most   difficult year for a player and where we see the most   mistakes.  It   gets easier every year there after, except as players grow   and develop   over the summer they often come back much better than   expected.  We   use any information we can find and are always working on   solutions to   improve the process.<br>
                </p>
               
                <p><u>Why   can't little   Susie play with my little Sally?  I requested her on the   registration   form, why ask if you are not going to fulfill it?</u></p>
                <p>We   could choose to   not ask for your friend request preferences, but   thought it better to   please some people, rather than intentionally not   please anyone.  We   will make every attempt humanly possible to honor   requests, <u>but never at the   expense of team or league balance</u>.    The" friend request" is one of   the most utilized tools to destroy   team parity in youth sports.  We   suggest telling  your child, that you     don't always get what you want in life, and that she will make new     friends.  This will teach her more than basketball ever could.</p>
               
                <p><u>What size ball should we buy?</u></p>
                <p>Girls 1st-2nd:  27- 27.75</p>
                <p>Girls 3rd to 5th:  27.75-28<br>
                </p>
                <p>Girls 7th to Women's Adult:  28.5-29</p>
               
                <p>Boys 1st-2nd:  27- 27.75</p>
                <p>Boys 3rd to 6th:  28.5-29.00</p>
                <p>Boys 7th to Men's:  29.5 - 30</p>
                
                <p><u>We are neighbors, and need to carpool.</u></p>
                <p>You     may be able to   carpool with this player to practice if it works out.    We will   attempt,   if possible, to put these players in the same practice gym on   the same   night just not on the same team at the expense of league   balance, if   needed.  This is a known stacking trick and we are fully   aware of it.<br>
                </p>
                
                <p><u>Can head coaches pick their assistant's?<br>
                </u></p>
                <p>Yes,     you can pick   your own assistant, just not before the draft.  You MUST   DRAFT THEM,   via their child!   Of course we would never assign an   assistant to   you.  This is your choice.  However, you cannot pick your   assistant   prior to the draft.  In other words, <u>you must draft   your desired assistant coaches</u> child, if they are available, in order to have their parent become your   assistant,when you have an   opportunity to draft.  This prevents     stacking by coaches of very strong players joining up before the draft     to effectively render the season and draft meaningless.  This is   another classic stacking technique!<br>
                </p>
                
                <p><u>But, my assistant's child is only average, he's not that good?  Why can't I choose them before the draft?</u> </p>
                <p>This is a<u> league rule,</u> and we have to be consistent.    If their child is truly not that   strong a player, then you will have   nothing to worry about, as you   should have the chance to draft   them in the appropriate round later.</p>
               
                <p><u>Where and when do the adult leagues play?</u></p>
                <p>They   play at Shady   Side Academy's HS Mellon Gym, and Middle School Gym's in   Fox Chapel.    They usually have pickup in November, with games beginning   on the 1st   Monday in December, see our calendar for the specific   locations,   dates and times of pickup.  </p>
                
                <p><u>Do You Provide Referees for the Games?</u></p>
                <p>Yes,     we provide a   uniformed trained, and mentored referee for each game.    They are paid   by our league, which comes out of the league fees.  The   older the age   group, the   older the referees and higher the quality.   Adult Leagues   use 2 PIAA   ref's. Our younger refs do the youngest games as a training   ground, so   please be patient with them.  They are learning also.  <br>
                </p>
                
                <p><u>Do we have buy a T-shirt to play or is one provided?</u></p>
                <p>You   do not need to   buy an extra jersey. All players receive a Winter League   T-shirt with a   number as part of their paid registration and may keep   it afterward.</p>
                
                <p><u>Why don't we choose which size shirt we want to wear?</u></p>
                <p>The   teams are not   assigned until the 1 week before the 1st game thus not   leaving enough   time to order shirts specific to player, team, etc.    Also, we have   developed a formula that while not perfect, works well to   meet the   general needs of the vast majority.   We rarely have to replace   a   jersey with a different size.  However, if yours doesn't fit let our     uniform coordinator know this and they will work to rectify the     situation for you.</p>
               
                <p><u>When Does everything Start?</u></p>
                <p>  Usually the first week in December</p>
                
                <p><u>When will we find out what team we are on?</u></p>
                <p>Right   around   Thanksgiving.  If not, please contact your AGC, and not the   president   please.  Coaches are told they must communicate this to   parents around   then.<br>
                </p>
                
                <p><u>When do practices begin?</u></p>
                <p>On your assigned practice day, beginning the 1st day of December.</p>
                
                <p><u>When do games begin?</u></p>
                <p>Adult league games begin the 1st week of December.  Watch the calendar for pick up in November.</p>
                <p>Youth Leagues begin in December</p>
                
                <p><u>How many games do teams play during the season?</u></p>
                <p>The season consists of   between 9 games, plus playoffs, plus 3v3 for most age groups.  This is   providing their are no weather cancellations.  Some make up is possible   utilizing week day games.</p>
                
                <p><u>What dates does the season run?</u></p>
                <p>Begins: Saturday December to early March</p>

                <u>MARCH MADNESS PLAYOFF TOURNAMENT</u><br>
                <br>
                <p><u>Does everyone make the year end March Madness Playoff Tournament?</u></p>
                <p>Yes, all teams make it!  The season determines the seeding of the brackets. <br>
                </p>
                
                <p><u>When is the tournament for the youth leagues?</u></p>
                <p>Begins: End of Feb, or 1st of March<br>
                </p>
                <p>Ends:  All games in one week</p>
                <p>GAMES:  Played every night in every gym that week.</p>
                <p>GYMS:  Every gym in the district.</p>
                
                <p><u>When is the tournament for the Adult Leagues?</u></p>
                <p>Begins: 1st full week of March<br>
                </p>
                <p>Ends:  Thursday 2nd week of March</p>
                <p>GAMES:  Played every night</p>
                <p>GYMS:  Shady Side Mellon gym</p>
                
                <p><u>Can I request not to play a certain day during March Madness week?</u></p>
                <p>No, we do not have   the flexibility in the schedule to accommodate individual requests.  My   advice is, don't schedule anything for that time period</p>
                
                <p><u>When will the tournament schedule be posted?<br>
                </u></p>
                <p>It   will be out the in   early February.  You may only guess what you will be   seeded though   and therefore may only project what days and times you   will play.</p>
                
                <p><u>Why are some March Madness games so late into the evening?</u></p>
                <p>Because   of the strain   on the schedule, and the huge numbers of games needed   especially in   the early rounds, we are forced to play a little later   this one week.    We do try and avoid this is possible.   If the games are   too late for   your child, please tell your coach that you will be   skipping the   playoffs, so they will know what to expect.</p>
